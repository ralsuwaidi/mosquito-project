## MSc Literature Review Report

The report is extremely well referenced and the quality of English is high. The review covers aspects of mosquito behaviour and VR systems and presents balanced and well structured arguments about both topics. The novel features of the project are well expressed. I think a short section could be added to explain how the input data to the project has been captured, referring to the paper presented at the Optical Society of America meeting on 3D imaging and holographic microscopy in July 2016.

A number of aspects of expression and content are marked on the hardcopy of the report. Other specific comments are made below.

· It may be worth making clear about the mosquito species and diseases that each species is responsible for. The primary malaria vector is anopheles gambiae and main activity is at dusk and dawn as well as some activity overnight (a minor malaria vector is Culex quinquefasciatus). Hence bednets are applicable to prevention of malaria transmission as people can sleep under bednets. The aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for dengue fever, Chikungunya and Zika and main activity is during the day, therefore bednets are not applicable (unless people have to stay in bed all day!).

· There feels to be some overlap of content in section 1.3.1, the sub-section ‘Interaction with host odour’ also contains some of the discussion about CO2 that is also in the next sub-section.

· Quite a few of the references deal with aedes aegypti behaviour – some of these will be generic character traits (the same as anopheles gambiae) and perhaps this is worth pointing out. The data you have, and most of our information to date relates to malaria vectors.

· Page 6. The dialogue about flow driven spread of odours / CO2 and diffusion is relevant and well made. Similar results for anopheles gambiae were obtained and reported by Gibson in a 1995 paper (showing response to visual cues).

· The aspects on diffusion could be increased and would show an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms. Diffusion is described by a mean squared displacement and a diffusion coefficient, see http://www.chem.umass.edu/~dgross/chem471/lecture/2009.11.04inked.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory) . The point is that in a low Reynolds number flow – as in the air – that the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the radius of the particle. Hence if you look up size of a CO2 molecule and size of a gaseous hydrocarbon / body odour molecule then it may show which molecule has greater diffusion, mean squared distance. I agree this is a bit removed from the main topic of your dissertation – but its interesting and relevant to understanding mosquito response to odour cues.

· The importance of the odour plume is clear to mosquito behaviour and host seeking. It then leads to the question as to whether the odour plume could be included as part of the virtual environment. The plume is essentially a truncated conical shape and could be visualised as a semi transparent solid object? This would be in contrast to the bednet which is a surface and would also be visualised as semi transparent in the VR environment??

· Use of ‘Physics’ models – gravity, inertia etc. Its not obvious to me that this is needed for simply visualising the mosquito flight tracks. The experiments contain mosquitoes that are operating in a real environment and subject to gravity and their own inertia, and the imaging sensor records their flight tracks and processes out the 3-D co-ordinates at each frame time. Hence in creating a VR of the tracks there doesn’t need to be any accommodation for gravity

or inertia. The use of gravity and inertia in this context may have a couple of uses. You may have noticed that the ‘noise’ in the z co-ordinate data is much higher than in x and y – might the physics enable this noise to be smoothed out? Gravity / inertia combined with the measured mosquito kinematics might enable the work done by the mosquito to be estimated and displayed during the VR rendering (perhaps this could be hinted in as part of a further work section in the final report).

· In the VR review section could you look at whether there are any references to designing thermal / solar technologies that are more directly relevant to Sustainable Energy Technologies? If so, sdd a few references and content in the literature review.
