# Mosquito VR Project

## Things I did:
1. convert code into unity using java
2. test acceleration using lerp and weights
3. test code in unity
4. creating the bed-mesh and importing it into unity using the proper ratios
5. added surrounding to test the bed-mesh with code, also made the fly light up

## What I have to do:
- create menu
- a way to choose different flies
- separate the different fly data
- create a better surrounding
- clicker to become the view o the mosquito and the observer

## To-Do:
1. Write up all things I did
  - ~~test movement code~~
  - data and conversion into unity
  - making the environment
  - making the bed-net
2. Make a way to split the data into different mosquitoes
